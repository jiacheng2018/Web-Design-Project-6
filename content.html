                Chapter One
            </h1> 
            <p>
              Once upon a time in the middle of winter, when the flakes of snow were falling like feathers
              from the sky, a queen sat at a window sewing, and the frame of the window was made of black
              ebony. And whilst she was sewing and looking out of the window at the snow, she pricked
              her finger with the needle, and three drops of blood fell upon the snow. And the red looked
              pretty upon the white snow, and she thought to herself, would that I had a child as white as
              snow, with lips as red as blood, and hair as black as the wood of the window-frame.
            </p>

          Soon after that she had a little daughter, who was as white as snow, her lips were as red
          as blood, and her hair was as black as ebony, and she was therefore called little snow-white.   
          And when the child was born, the queen died.

     After a year had passed the king took to himself another wife. She was a beautiful woman,
     but proud and haughty, and she could not bear that anyone else should surpass her in beauty.
     She had a wonderful looking-glass, and when she stood in front of it and looked at herself in
     it, and said,
     “looking-glass, looking-glass, on the wall, who in this land is the fairest of all.”

           But now the poor child was all alone in the great forest, and so terrified that she looked at all
the leaves on the trees, and did not know what to do. Then she began to run, and ran over
sharp stones and through thorns, and the wild beasts ran past her, but did her no harm.
She ran as long as her feet would go until it was almost evening, then she saw a little cottage
and went into it to rest herself. Everything in the cottage was small, but neater and cleaner
than can be told. There was a table on which was a white cover, and seven little plates,
and on each plate a little spoon, moreover, there were seven little knives and forks, and seven
little mugs. Against the wall stood seven little beds side by side, and covered with snow-white
counterpanes.
